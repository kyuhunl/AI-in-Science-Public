0,"The dominant systematic uncertainties for the TPM1 measurements arise from the background subtraction and a tracking efficiency correction.The efficiency correction is obtained by inserting simulated single tracks into actual data events and analyzing the reconstruction probability using the same track reconstruction code employed for the experimental results.The tracking efficiency in the TPM1 counter ranges from almost unity for low density, peripheral scattering events, to ≈0.9 for central events at 90 • and ≈0.85 for central events at 40 • .In contrast, the dominant systematic uncertainty near mid-rapidity for the SiMA and TMA arrays reflect the single-particle response calibrations obtained for the constituent detectors of these arrays.At larger pseudorapidity values, the uncertainty in the background subtraction also becomes significant.In addition, the relatively thick scintillator elements of the TMA array are expected to be somewhat sensitive to beam related background that does not come from the collision vertex.These effects lead to the somewhat larger uncertainty quoted for the TMA as compared to the SiMA.The BBC systematic uncertainty is dominated by the background correction.Overall, the systematic uncertainties for the different detector systems are: SiMA, ±8% for η<1.5, increasing to ±10% for η ≥2.5; TMA, ±12% for η <1.5 increasing to ±15% for η ≥2.0; BBC, ±10%; TPM1, +9%/-7% for the most central events and ±6% for the most peripheral.",16707705

1,"1 shows the multiplicity distribution of charged particles established by the MA, normalized to the maximum observed multiplicity.The independent multiplicity measurements of the SiMA and TMA detectors are summed for this figure, after the SiMA multiplicity was rescaled to account for the difference in the geometric coverage of the two arrays.Where possible, the location of the interaction vertex was determined using TPM1.Otherwise, the vertex determined from the BBC or ZDC data was adopted.The charged particle densities reported in this paper are obtained almost exclusively using the TPM1 and BBC vertices and are relatively insensitive to the specific choice.The multiplicity distribution requires that a coincidence occurs between the two ZDC detectors, an interaction vertex be located within 30 cm of the array center (as obtained by one of the three possible vertex measurements), and that a TMA multiplicity of at least four be observed.The TMA multiplicity cut eliminates events corresponding to beam-gas interactions and for cases where tails of pedestals for individual detector elements add to simulate real collision events.Based on HIJING simulations, where the shape of the multiplicity distribution for events with fewer than 200 tile hits is used to estimate the missing yield for events with fewer than four tile hits, it is estimated that the TMA array observes cleanly 95% of the total nuclear cross sections.This value is used to correct for the missing cross section where the tile multiplicity is less than four when determining the final multiplicities.",16707705

1,"3 shows the Au+Au results for large pseudorapidities in terms of the pseudorapidity shifted by the beam rapidity, thus allowing for a comparison with SPS Pb+Pb data [4] within the ""limiting fragmentation"" picture [16].This hypothesis states that at high energies the number of particles produced by the ""wounded projectile"" nucleons should be independent of the details of the ""target"", the ""projectile"", and the beam energy.When shifted by the beam rapidity, effectively translating to the beam's reference frame (assuming similar values for the pseudorapidy and rapidity variables), the normalized yields near η ′ (= η − y beam ) = 0 should be system and energy independent.A ""limiting fragmentation"" behavior has been observed in pp, pp, p-emulsion, and π-emulsion data (see references 34-37 of ref.",16707705

1,"4 we compare HIJING [13], UrQMD [18], and AMPT model [19][20][21] calculations to the data for different centrality ranges.HIJING is a model that places special emphasis on perturbative QCD processes leading to multiple minijet production from parton scatterings.The model, which does not include final state rescattering except for schematic jet quenching, is found to do a good job in describing the data at mid-rapidity, but underestimates the widths of the multiplicity distributions at all centralities.The AMPT model uses HIJING to generate the initial phase space of partons, but then extends the calculations to model the parton-parton collisions and the final hadronic interactions.By including these final state interactions, the widths of the multiplicity distributions are found to agree well with experiment, suggesting the importance of these final state interactions.It is also interesting to note that the LUCIFER code [22] gives similar results to AMPT but within a purely hadronic formulation.The UrQMD transport model accounts for hadronic interactions at low and intermediate energies in terms of interactions between known hadrons and their resonances and at higher energies in terms of excitations of color strings and their subsequent fragmentation.For the present RHIC data, the shape of the pseudorapidity distributions are well reproduced, however with the particle production being way too large.The current results appear to rule out the UrQMD model as a description of the RHIC data.",16707705
0,"The BRAHMS experiment has measured pseudorapidity densities of charged particles from Au+Au collisions at √ s N N =130 GeV over a large range of pseudorapidity as a function of collision centrality using several independent detector systems and methods.We observe an enhancement of particle production for central collisions at mid-rapidity, suggesting a breakdown in the simple scaling by the number of participant nucleons seen at larger pseudorapidities.Comparisons of the Au+Au fragmentation region data with SPS energy Pb+Pb results suggest that a ""limiting fragmentation"" behavior is seen for nucleus-nucleus collisions and is, in fact, already reached at the lower energy.With the inclusion of final hadronic interactions, parton scattering models are found to give a good description of the observed behaviors.",16707705

12,"However, such an effect typically requires a vacancy concentration well above 10%.",248085185

16,"Further, as the clusters freeze they will tend to exert random magnetic fields on each other thus enhancing the spin disorder and causing the time to equilibrate to diverge exponentially with decreasing temperature, forming a novel spin glass state with two short range orders.",248085185

6,"Although the dynamical interpretation in this case is not as simple as in the galaxy-galaxy case, we note that the draining mechanism advocated by RW06 would probably lead to coherent, rather than incoherent motions, which would produce a very different distortion pattern.",15989212
7,W07 suggested that the finger-of-god distortion could be a geometrical effect deriving from observing Lyα absorbers along lines-of-sights that run along some radially- To check this hypothesis we exploited the distant observer approximations and computed the cross-correlation function by considering redshift distortions along one Cartesian axis at a time.,15989212

5,Specific results for estimated slit caliber based on the maximum slit opening are listed in Table 2.,237556021
6,"We recall that to the maximum IES opening displacement, s , we must impose the 0 s due to axisymmetric sinus opening under the all-around pulling pressure P pull to arrive at a total IES opening of s = 0 s + b s ; this is explained in Section 4.",237556021
7,"Table 2 shows results for a range of pulling pressures, P pull , that clearly indicates a natural progression of slit caliber with increasing P pull .",237556021
8,"We note that, without stress fiber contraction, s may reach values in the range 1.3μm to which 0 s must be added; hence, total calibers in access of 1.8−1.9 μm are thereby envisioned.",237556021
9,"We note, however, that   this is strongly mitigated by the action of stress fiber uniform contraction as in Model 1a.",237556021
10,"With uniform stress fiber contraction, there is a monotonic trend of decreasing caliber as shown.",237556021
11,"Nonetheless, the total calibers predicted with the WSM that sets L EC = 16 μm are rather large and generally may slightly exceed the expected range of 1−1.5 μm ; based on the SEM evidence discussed above, we then used a value of L EC = 8 μm .",237556021

0,Malawi Malaria Context,9229284
0,"In comparison to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi was slower to realize adequate donor support before 2008 [3] which inevitably resulted in a much slower scale up and lower levels of intervention coverage [34,35].",9229284
1,In 2001 the Malawian Government adopted a policy on insecticide treated nets (ITN) to ensure 60% coverage by 2005.,9229284
2,"The second Malaria Strategic Plan (MSP) [35], launched in June 2005, sought to scale up interventions to ensure 80% coverage of ITNs in high risk groups and access to appropriate treatment by all those at risk of malaria by 2010.",9229284
3,"In the most recent MSP launched in 2011 these targets have been revised to achieve universal coverage of the four main malaria control interventions: long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLIN), indoor residual spraying (IRS), intermittent presumptive treatment for pregnant women, and prompt treatment with effect artemisinin-based combination therapy for uncomplicated malaria by 2015 [35].",9229284
0,In 2000 less than 4% of Malawian children were protected by an ITN [36].,9229284
1,The dominant ITN delivery approach before 2007 was a combined full cost recovery retail sector promotion along with subsidized cost ITN distribution through antenatal clinics and through the community [37].,9229284
2,The first integrated free mass distribution of ITNs was in 2007.,9229284
3,"In July 2008 the Ministry of Health, using funds from the Global Fund (GF), launched a largescale distribution campaign of free ITN to, newborns, children under the age of five years and pregnant women.",9229284
4,Various household survey data have been collected in Malawi since 2000 aimed at defining the proportion of children below the age of five sleeping under an ITN during the night before the survey.,9229284
0,"Initially IRS activities were limited to a single pilot district, Nkhotakota in 2007 covering 27,000 houses in the northern section and were subsequently repeated in 2008 and 2009.",9229284

2,"This has now been scaled-up covering approximately 500,000 households in five additional highly endemic districts in December 2010: Karonga, Nkhata Bay, Mangochi, Chikwawa, and Nsanje Districts [38].",9229284
0,Between 2000 and 2007 sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was the only drug available in most government clinics [37] even though the efficacy of SP declined rapidly over this period.,9229284
1,"Officially, first line treatment policy was changed in November 2007 to the more efficacious artemether-lumefathrine (AL) but the new policy was not effectively implemented until early 2008.",9229284
2,"Additionally, in order to improve access to treatment, community based-case management of malaria was introduced in 2009 in hard to reach areas of Malawi with care provided by health assistants based in village health clinics.",9229284
3,In spite of this in 2010 access to effective treatment remained low [34] with less than 30% of febrile children under five treated with AL in 2010 [34].,9229284
0,"Thus within the context of financing, intervention delivery and coverage, between 2000 and 2006, there was a definite lack of significant progress toward achieving internationally agreed and nationally adopted coverage targets of malaria interventions.",9229284
1,"However, starting in 2007 there was an increase in external funding from the Global Fund (GF) and PMI, implementation of AL for treatment and a revised ITN policy to rapidly scale up ITN coverage including the use of mass campaigns.",9229284
0,Selection of Hospital Sites,9229284
0,"Malawi is divided into three regions: Central, Northern and Southern with a total of 28 districts.",9229284
1,"Within this there are 4 central hospitals, 22 designated district general hospitals and 46 rural hospitals managed by either the government or mission sectors.",9229284
2,District hospitals provide secondary level health care services and serve to support peripheral clinical services by providing in-patient care and other specialized services.,9229284
3,"Despite recent efforts at improvement, traditionally routine health management information system (HMIS) reporting from all levels of service provision has been largely incomplete over long time periods and often inappropriately summarized by cause or age.",9229284
4,To overcome the perennial inadequacies of routine HMIS data we selected a sub-set of hospitals for a more detailed inpatient review where each hospital had records available for investigation and represented the malaria ecologies typical of the country.,9229284
5,The four hospitals selected for review are shown in Figure 1.,9229284
6,"These are located at Salima in the Central Region of Malawi along Lake Malawi and Mwanza in the South Western Region of Malawi, all areas historically supporting high, intense perennial malaria transmission; Rumphi in the Northern Region and Zomba in the Southern Region both have historically moderate risks of malaria infection [39].",9229284

0,Defining Hospital Catchment Areas,9229284
0,We computed catchment populations to standardise the admission data across the four hospitals.,9229284
1,Previously we have attempted to define catchment areas using addresses of admissions in Kenya [41] which were used to develop a representative catchment radius and applied to hospital data from Uganda [42].,9229284
2,A slightly different approach was used here.,9229284
3,All higher level facilities (hospitals) surrounding each study site were selected from the Malawi Health facility database [43].,9229284
4,"The spatial positions of the hospitals within a region were assembled in ArcGIS version 9.3 (ESRI, Inc., Redland, CA, USA) to define nearest distance (Thiessen) polygons around each hospital assuming that all hospitals had an equally weighted draw on patients whose distances travelled were assumed to be Euclidian (in straight lines).",9229284
5,"This assumption was necessary because the precise shape of the hospital catchments are hard to empirically define as the only measures of health service use and travel distance are available from lower order facilities providing primary out-patient care [44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] and not inpatient care which is likely to have different properties [45,48,52].",9229284
6,Thiessen polygons were defined based on the bisection of the perpendicular lines of each neighbouring hospital and represent polygons whose boundaries define the area that is closest to each point (i.e.,9229284
7,hospital) relative to all other points.,9229284
0,"Using the lowest level of administrative units available, Traditional Authorities, all units that intersected the boundaries of the Thiessen polygon of the study hospital were included and used as the first step in defining the hospital's catchment.",9229284

4,These discrepancies between the atlases and the target create challenges for label fusion approaches.,55367888
0,"For covariate information, we take the weighted sum of the SDL maps for each atlas (rescaled to the unit interval), where each atlas is weighted voxelwise by its T 1 intensity similarity with the target T 1 image.",55367888
1,The use of atlas-target image agreement is common Figure 7: Axial view of one slice of the manually segmented hippocampus (top) and six atlas segmentations (bottom two rows) for the label fusion example.,55367888
2,The target brain has been diagnosed with AD; the atlases come from healthy controls.,55367888
3,"among modern label fusion algorithms and has proven to be useful, so we use it here.",55367888
4,"To further guide the segmentation, however, we recognize that the hippocampus is a structure consisting only of gray matter.",55367888
5,Thus we use a pre-computed tissue class segmentation to compute voxelwise gray matter indicators for inclusion in our regression model.,55367888
6,"The tissue class segmentation is obtained via the ATROPOS algorithm (Avants et al., 2011b).",55367888
7,"The SDL map and tissue class segmentation, along with the manually-segmented target image, are displayed in Supplementary Figure 4.",55367888
8,We include an interaction term to downweight the effect of the presence of gray matter when a voxel is thought to be far away from the hippocampus.,55367888
0,"To elicit the prior on the regression coefficients via CMP, we use pseudodata to impose our prior knowledge that (i) gray matter and a small SDL has a very high likelihood of truly belonging to the hippocampus, (ii) a large SDL and not gray matter is very likely to be external to the hippocampus, (iii) gray matter with a large SDL is somewhat likely external to the hippocampus, and (iv) a small SDL but segmented as not belonging to gray matter has a marginal probability of being part of the hippocampus, due to possibly misclassified  There is considerable uncertainty about the edges.",55367888
1,"If a researcher were only interested in the hippocampal volume for the patient, these probabilities could be used directly to estimate the volume, as discussed below.",55367888
0,One can threshold the posterior probabilities to obtain a binary inclusion map.,55367888
1,"After thresholding, we compare the resulting segmentation to those obtained by simple majority voting, globally-weighted majority voting, locally-weighted majority voting, and JLF.",55367888
2,The global weighting is inversely proportional to each atlas' average T 1 intensity difference from the target.,55367888
3,Local weighting is done similarly using voxel-specific intensity differences.,55367888
4,Figure   9 displays one slice of the manual segmentation along with that which is obtained by thresholding the posterior inclusion probabilities at 0.5.,55367888
5,"The hippocampus is a relatively small structure compared to the full three-dimensional image (as can be seen in, e.g., Supplementary Figure 4).",55367888
6,"In this case, Taha and Hanbury (2015) argue that the Dice coefficient defined in Section 3 is not the best measure for evaluating a segmentation.",55367888
7,"However, the volume of the hippocampus is important for volumetry in the study of AD progression.",55367888
8,"Thus, we follow the suggestion of Taha and Hanbury (2015) and use the volume similarity as an evaluative metric, defined as V S = 1 − |F N − F P |/(2T P + F P + F N ), where F N, F P, and T P denote false negatives, false positives, and true positives, respectively.",55367888
9,Bayesian label fusion attains V S = 0.989.,55367888
10,"This is competitive with JLF, the current state-of-the-art (V S = 0.997), and superior to both simple and weighted voting procedures.",55367888
11,(VS values are displayed in Figure   9.),55367888
12,"Unlike the other automatic segmentations, the fully Bayesian label fusion produces measures of uncertainty in the form of a posterior probability distribution that can be used to derive marginal distributions of any quantity of interest, as we discuss below.",55367888
13,"Further, our proposed model also has the ability to estimate the spatially-varying reliability parameters for each atlas.",55367888
14,Supplementary Figure 6 displays the sensitivity and specificity maps for one selected atlas.,55367888
15,We see smooth decay of sensitivity between regions of high agreement and low agreement with the manual segmentations.,55367888
16,"Since the sensitivity is conditional on the voxel truly being part of the structure (T v = 1), the model is only capable of estimating sensitivity in areas where it estimates a high probability of the voxel truly being part of the structure.",55367888
0,The fields return to their prior means as they move away from the structure estimate.,55367888
1,"Similarly, the specificity values are estimated to be very high away from the targeted structure, where all atlases agree on the voxels being excluded.",55367888
2,"As already mentioned, only healthy brains are used as atlases.",55367888
3,The systematic differences are not completely captured by atlas-target image dissimilarities.,55367888
4,"Despite accounting for image dissimilarity, there is a tendency for the established methods to over-segment the hippocampus.",55367888
5,The Bayesian label fusion model facilitates explicit incorporation of the estimated gray matter pattern as a predictor.,55367888
6,"Our prior specification allows for the possibility that the tissue classes are incorrectly assigned in some places, but are mostly reliable.",55367888
7,The effect of the gray matter segmentation as auxiliary information can be clearly seen by comparing it even with our own model in which this information is ignored but the model is otherwise identical.,55367888
8,"Figure 10 displays the posterior inclusion probabilities obtained without using the gray matter information, along with the results already presented for reference.",55367888
0,Using only the intensity-similarity-weighted distance labels yields a Bayesian regression analogue to the other approaches that only weight by intensity similarity.,55367888
1,The additional tissue class information is able to prevent oversegmentation of the diseased structure.,55367888
0,"In practice, an anatomical structure is segmented to obtain important information such and without (right) using a gray matter tissue class segmentation as a covariate in the Bayesian label fusion model.",55367888
1,Note that each image displays only the subset of the full brain image that was used for the label fusion -the smallest rectangle containing the largest segmentation.,55367888
2,The coronal view displays no structure since the slice shown is in between the left and right hippocampus.,55367888
0,as its volume or average image intensity within the structure.,55367888
1,"In our case, segmenting the hippocampus is a step toward estimating its volume.",55367888
2,"If we only obtain a binary map, then the only way to estimate the volume is by summing the indicators.",55367888
3,"Doing so ignores many sources of uncertainty, including image pre-processing, registration error, biological variation, and rater variability.",55367888
4,"Monte Carlo sampling also facilitates estimation of a distribution of plausible volumes throughM (k) , defined in Section 3.",55367888
5,"Figure 11 displays the marginal volume densities for the diseased brain of interest, both with and without gray matter included in the Bayesian label fusion model.",55367888
6,Vertical lines indicate the manually-segmented volume and the volume estimates from the other procedures considered.,55367888
7,The benefit of including the gray matter information is again evident with the improved agreement of the volume distribution with the manual segmentation.,55367888
8,"In this case, though, we see that even without the gray matter information the Bayesian model outperforms the three majority voting procedures.",55367888
0,Aggregated Results,55367888
0,Here we present the results of using the control brain images as atlases for each of the six AD patients in our dataset.,55367888
1,Figure 12 summarizes the volume estimates and volume similarities between the automatic and manual segmentations.,55367888
2,"In terms of volume similarity, our approach and JLF separate themselves from the three voting approaches.",55367888
3,"In addition to being competitive with the current state of the art, our approach is the only one that meaningfully produces measures of associated uncertainty, depicted in this case as 99% posterior credible intervals.",55367888
4,This uncertainty is particularly evident in the second subject from the top depicted in the left panel of Figure 12.,55367888
5,The point estimate (posterior mean) is quite far from the manually segmented volume relative to differences in the other brain images.,55367888
0,"However, the posterior distribution indicates a large amount of uncertainty about this particular estimate.",55367888
1,"Indeed, the MCMC trace plot of volume estimates for this subject (labeled 1263), displayed in Supplementary Figure 6, suggest that the marginal posterior distribution of volume is bi-modal.",55367888
2,This is a feature of the posterior distribution that an optimization routine would likely miss.,55367888
3,"Lastly, we remark that even a trained expert will produce slightly different manual segmentations of the brain on two different occasions, so there is uncertainty associated with each manual segmentation itself.",55367888
4,This is not quantified here.,55367888
5,Thus it is impossible to assess any 'significant' difference between volume estimates from our proposed approach and a manually estimated volume.,55367888
0,These results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a full three-dimensional segmentation as well as additional useful information that would be unavailable otherwise.,55367888
0,Posterior probability maps can be used to summarize where the hippocampus is likely to be.,55367888
1,A simple thresholding rule yields image similarities that are competitive with the stateof-the-art when using healthy brains as atlases for diseased cases.,55367888
2,"However, thresholding is unnecessary when the goal is to estimate the volume of the hippocampus, as shown by the availability of a posterior volume distribution.",55367888
3,Incorporating tissue class information into a generative Bayesian model for segmentation results in more faithful estimates of the hippocampal volume along with meaningful measures of uncertainty.,55367888
