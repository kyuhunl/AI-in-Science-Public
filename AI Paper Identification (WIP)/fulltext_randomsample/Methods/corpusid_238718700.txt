Measurements

The concentrations of OC and elemental carbon (EC) were measured using a multiwavelength carbon analyzer (DRI model 2015; Aerosol Inc., USA). Typically, a 0.58 cm 2 punch of the filter was placed on a boat inside the thermal desorption chamber of the analyzer, and then stepwise heating was applied. Carbon fractions were obtained following the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments (IMPROVE-A) thermal/optical reflectance (TOR) protocol (Chow et al., 2007). Replicate analyses were conducted once every 10 samples. A blank sample was also analyzed and used to correct the sample results.

A punch (4.7 cm 2 ) of each quartz filter was ultrasonically extracted with 10.0 mL deionized water (resistivity = 18.2 M cm −1 ) for 40 min. The aqueous extracts were filtrated through syringe filters (PTFE, 0.22 µm) to remove insoluble materials. Ion chromatography (Metrohm, Switzerland) coupled with Metrosep C6-150 and A6-150 columns was used to detect water-soluble ions (Cl − , NO − 3 , PO − 4 , SO 2− 4 , Na + , NH + 4 , K + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ ) with a detection limit (DL) range of 0.001-0.002 µg m −3 .

Five saccharide alcohols (glycerol, erythritol, inositol, arabitol, and mannitol) and five primary saccharides (fructose, glucose, mannose, sucrose, and trehalose), together with three anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan), were quantified by an improved high-performance anion-exchange chromatograph coupled with a pulsed am-perometric detector (Engling et al., 2006;Caseiro et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2013). This method developed by Engling et al. (2006) was validated to be a powerful method for the detection of carbohydrates without derivatization techniques, and it has been successfully applied to the atmospheric tracers (e.g., Zhang et al., 2010;Holden et al., 2011;Liang et al., 2013a, b;Li et al., 2016a, b;Kalogridis et al., 2018;Yan et al., 2018). The separation of the saccharides was performed on an ion chromatograph (Metrohm, Switzerland) equipped with a Metrosep Carb 4-250 analytical column and a guard column. The aqueous eluent of sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate was pumped by a dual-pump module at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min −1 . The low concentration of 50 mM sodium hydroxide and 10 mM sodium acetate (eluent A) was applied to pump 1, while the high concentration of 250 mM sodium hydroxide and 50 mM sodium acetate (eluent B) was applied to pump 2. The gradient generator was set as 0-10 min, 100 % of eluent A; 10-20 min, 50 % of eluent A and 50 % of eluent B; 20-50 min, 100 % of eluent B; and 50-60 min, 100 % of eluent A for equilibration. The extraction efficiency of this analytical method was determined to be better than 90 % based on analysis of quartz filters spiked with known amounts of mannitol. The method DL of the referred carbohydrate compounds was 0.005-0.01 mg L −1 . All carbohydrate species were below detection limits in the field blanks.


Other data

The meteorological parameters, including temperature (T ), relative humidity (RH), solar irradiation (W m −2 ), and rainfall (mm) were obtained from the Physical Sciences Laboratory of NOAA (https://psl.noaa.gov, last access: 8 September 2020). The temporal changes in meteorological variables over the observation sites during the sampling periods are shown in Fig. S2.

In order to characterize the origin and transport pathway of the air masses to the sampling sites, 72 h back-trajectories of the aerosol were calculated using the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model developed by NOAA/ARL (Draxler and Hess, 1998) via the NOAA ARL READY website (http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/ HYSPLIT.php, last access: 6 September 2020) with an endpoint height of 1500 m. To investigate the influence of BB emissions, fire pixel counts were obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations on NASA satellites (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/, last access: 3 September 2020).


Statistical analysis

A Pearson's correlation test was performed using the statistical product and service solutions software for the dataset containing ambient concentrations of the measured saccharides, inorganic ions, and solar irradiation. Non-negative ma-trix factorization (NMF) analysis was utilized to resolve potential emission source and estimate their contributions to atmospheric saccharides. NMF introduced by Lee and Seung (1999) was similar to positive matrix factorization (PMF). Both methods find two matrices (termed the contribution matrix of W and the source profile matrix of H) to reproduce the input data matrix (V) using the factorization approach (V = WH) as a positive constraint (W ≥ 0 and H ≥ 0). However, PMF forces the negative factors to be positive, but the NMF method only retains non-negative factors. NMF minimizes the conventional least-squares error and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence (Shang et al., 2018). Therefore, the results obtained from NMF are more responsive to the original characteristics of input dataset and fewer factors will be extracted . Half of the DL was used for the value below the detection limit. In this study, galactosan, mannose, and inositol were excluded, because their concentration in most samples was below the DL. Concentrations of the other 10 saccharide species for a total of 91 samples were subjected to NMF analysis. The uncertainties in NMF analysis were estimated as 0.3 plus the analytical detection limit according to the method by Xie et al. (1999). The constant 0.3 corresponding to the log (geometric standard deviation) was calculated from the normalized concentrations for all measured species, and it was used to represent the variation of measurements.
