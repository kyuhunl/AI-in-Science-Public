Materials and Methods

Cell Lines, Viruses and Compounds BHK-21, Vero, Huh7 and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 lg/mL of streptomycin in 5% CO 2 at 37°C.

The wild type (WT) CHIKV (GenBank accession No. KC488650) and eGFP-CHIKV stocks were produced from the infectious cDNA clones ) and stored in aliquots at -80°C. The WT Sindbis virus (SINV, strain AR339) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV, strain SFV4) were kindly provided by Prof. Qing-Zhen Liu from Wuhan University and Prof. Xi Zhou from Wuhan Institute of Virology, respectively. The Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, strain TC-83) was generated by lipofection (DMRIE-C Reagent, Invitrogen) of Vero cells with the transcribed viral genomic RNA from the linearized infectious cDNA clone of the TC-83 vaccine strain.

The lycorine was purchased from Sichuan Victory Biological Technology Co., Ltd., China.


Plasmid Construction

We have constructed two kinds of replicons to compare the replication efficiency: the CHIKV-sg-Rluc and CHIKV-nsP3-Rluc-replicon. The former was constructed by replacing the structural protein genes of the WT CHIKV with a Renilla luciferase gene that was initiated by a sg promoter, the latter was constructed by inserting the Renilla luciferase gene after codon 490 of the nsP3 gene (Kummerer et al. 2012). An inactivating GDD to GAA mutation in the catalytic site of nsP4 was introduced to obtain the CHIKV-nsP3-Rluc-nsP4mut-replicon (Utt et al. 2016). For the purpose of comparison of translation efficiency, two constructs were designed. One is the T7 promoter-based construct expressing firefly luciferase that contains the 5 0 and 3 0 UTR of CHIKV, the 77 N-terminal amino acid residues of nsP1, a firefly luciferase reporter, and a polyadenylation region followed by a T7 transcription terminator (Utt et al. 2016). The other is a T7 promoter-based sgRNA expressing Renilla luciferase. The sgRNA includes the sg-5 0 UTR and 3 0 UTR of CHIKV, a Renilla luciferase reporter and a polyadenylation region.


Electroporation

Approximately 5 lg of RNA was electroporated into 8 9 10 6 BHK-21 cells in 0.8 mL of cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5) in a 0.4-cm cuvette with the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) using settings of 0.85 kV and 25 lF, pulsing three times with 3 s intervals. After a 10 min recovery at room temperature, the transfected cells were diluted in 20 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS with or without 10 lmol/L of lycorine and transferred into 12-well plates. The cell lysates collected at the indicated time points were subjected to the luciferase assay as described previously ).


Antiviral Assay of Lycorine

eGFP-CHIKV reporter virus was used for rapid detection of inhibitory effects of lycorine and its derivatives. Vero cells seeded in 12-well plates (2 9 10 5 cells per well) were infected with eGFP-CHIKV at an MOI of 0.01. At 36 hours post infection (hpi), the eGFP expression was detected under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000) in the presence of different concentrations of lycorine or 10 lmol/L of derivatives. For dose-dependent inhibition of lycorine on CHIKV in different cell lines or other alphaviruses, Vero, BHK-21, Huh7, A549 cells infected with WT CHIKV or Vero cells infected with WT SINV, SFV and VEEV at an MOI of 0.01 were treated with increasing concentrations of lycorine. The culture media were collected at 12 hpi for SINV and at 24 hpi for SFV and VEEV. Viral titers were quantified by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells as described previously . The antiviral activity of lycorine was expressed as 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) which indicated the compound concentration required to achieve 50% of viral titer reduction and was calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software 5.0.


Cytotoxicity Assays

The cytotoxicity of lycorine or its derivatives on cells was examined with CCK-8 assay kit. In brief, different cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 9 10 4 cells per well) and allowed to grow for 24 h before treatment. Afterwards, the twofold serial dilutions of lycorine were added to the cells. At 48 h, the cells were incubated with 10 lL of CCK8 reagent (cell counting kit-8, Bimake) for 1 h at 37°C. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded by a multimode microplate reader (Varioskan Flash; Thermo Fisher, Finland). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the treated cells to the control (untreated) cells. For each lycorine concentration, six wells were performed in parallel and the mean values of the cell viability were calculated. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software 5.0 to determine the cytotoxic concentration at which 50% of the cells are viable.


Disinfection Test

To exclude the possibility of degermation of lycorine, a disinfectant test was designed. Briefly, equal volumes of eGFP-CHIKV (2 9 10 4 PFU in 100 lL) and 10 lmol/L of lycorine were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The MicroSpin S-400 HR columns (GE Healthcare) were used to trap the lycorine before inoculation into Vero cells. At 24 hpi, the eGFP expression was captured under a fluorescence microscope.


Time-of-Addition Assay

To determine the step inhibited by lycorine during viral life cycle, a time-of-addition assay was performed. Vero cells infected with WT CHIKV at an MOI of 10 for 1 h at 37°C were treated with 10 lmol/L of lycorine at the following time points: pre-infection (-2-0 h), during infection (0-1 h), and postinfection (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h). Meanwhile, 0.1% DMSO was added at the same time as a control. The supernatants collected at 12 hpi were subjected to viral titer quantification by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells as described above.


Statistical Analysis

The two-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there were significant differences (P \ 0.05) in all experiments. The statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric test in GraphPad Prism 5.0.
