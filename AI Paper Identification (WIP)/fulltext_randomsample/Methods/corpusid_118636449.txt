Observations and data preparation

1H 0419-577 was observed in May 2010 with XMM-Newton for ∼167 ks. The observing time was split into two observations (Obs. ID 0604720301 and 0604720401 respectively) which were performed in two consecutive satellite orbits. For the present analysis, we used the EPIC-pn (Strüder et al. 2001) and the Optical Monitor (OM, Mason et al. 2001) data. In the UV, besides the HST-COS observation simultaneous to our XMM-Newton observation, the source has been observed twice with the Far Ultraviolet Space Explorer (FUSE), respectively in 2003 and in 2006. In this analysis we used the FUSE flux measurements reported in the literature (Dunn et al. 2008;Wakker & Savage 2009). Finally, we retrieved all the available archival datasets from the XMM-Newton archive and we used them to study the source variability.


The X-ray data

We processed the present datasets and all the archival Observation Data Files (ODF) with the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS), version 10.0, and with the HEAsoft FTOOLS, version 6.12. We refer the reader to Paper I for a detailed description of the data reduction.

For the present datasets, we extracted the EPIC-pn spectra from both 0604720301 and 0604720401 observation. We checked the stability of the spectrum in the two observations and we found no flux variability larger than ∼ 7%. Therefore, we summed up the two spectra into a single combined spectrum with a net exposure time of ∼ 97 ks after the background filtering. We used the FTOOLS mathpha and addarf to combine respectively the spectra and the Ancillary Response Files (ARF). We reduced all the archival datasets following the same standard procedure described in Paper I, and we discarded the datasets with ID 0148000301 and 0148000701 because they show a high contamination by background flares. Hence, we created the EPIC-pn spectra and spectral response matrices for all the good datasets.

We fitted all the X-ray spectra in the 0.3-10 keV band and we rebinned them in order to have at least 20 counts in each spectral bin, although this is not strictly necessary when using the C statistics. In Table 1 we provide the most relevant information of each XMM-Newton observation and we label them with numbers, following a chronological order.


The optical and UV data

As also described in Paper I, in our XMM-Newton observation OM data were collected in 4 broad-band filters: B, UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2. In the present analysis we used the OM filters count-rates for the purpose of spectral fitting. Therefore, we also retrieved from the ESA website 1 the spectral response matrices correspondent to each filter. We corrected the flux in the B filter to account for the host galaxy starlight contribution. For this, we used the same correction factor (56%) estimated in M11 for the stellar bulge of Mrk 509. Indeed, since Mrk 509 hosts a BH with a mass similar to the one in 1H 0419-577 , also the stellar mass of the bulge should be similar in this two galaxies (e.g., Merritt & Ferrarese 2001 Edmonds et al. 2011).Therefore, we could safely fit the FUSE fluxes together with the COS, OM and the EPIC-pn data that were simultaneously taken in 2010. For this purpose, we converted the UV fluxes back to count rates. We used the HST-COS sensitivity curve and the FUSE effective area (see also M11) for this. We outline all the UV and optical continuum values for 1H 0419-577 in Table 2. To check for a possible variability of the source in the optical-UV, we obtained also the OM fluxes from the archival XMM-Newton observations. For all the archival datasets, except Obs.1, OM data were available in the U, B, V, UVW1, and UVW2 filters.


Spectral modeling


A phenomenological model

We started with a pure phenomenological modeling of the present EPIC-pn spectrum, using SPEX (Kaastra et al. 1996), version 2.04.00. We first attempted to fit the spectrum in the 2.0-10.0 keV energy region with a canonical simple power law (Γ ∼ 1.6). The broadband residuals ( Fig. 2) show large deviations from this simple model. Indeed, besides a prominent soft excess in the 0.3-2.0 keV band, the model does not account for a broad trough between 2.0 and 4.0 keV. To phenomenologically account for this nontrivial spectral shape, a combination of 4 different spectral slopes would be required all over the 0.3-10.0 keV band. Nonetheless, a prominent peak in the model residuals ( Fig. 2), at ∼ 0.5 keV, is still unaccounted. We identified this feature as due to the blend of the O vii-O viii lines that we detected in the simultaneous RGS spectrum (Paper I). Furthermore, a shallow excess is seen at ∼ 5.5 keV. Fitting this feature with a delta-shaped emission line, centered at the nominal rest frame energy of the Fe Kα line-transition, does not leave any prominent structure in the residuals. If the line width is left free to vary, the fitted line-width (σ = 300 ± 200 eV) is well consistent with what previously reported for this source (Turner et al. 2009;Pounds et al. 2004a,b). We attempted also to decompose the Fe Kα in a combination of a broad plus a narrow component, but this exercise did not lead to a conclusive result. Despite the good data quality of the present dataset, the line-width of the broad component and the normalization of the narrow component cannot be constrained simultaneously.

In conclusion, the long exposure time of the present EPICpn spectrum unveiled a complex continuum spectral structure, Table 3. Best fit parameters for the reflection fitting.

Reflection Fitting

At first, we tested a disk reflection scenario for the present spectrum. As noticed in Sect. 1, this model has been already successfully applied to Obs. 1-5 (F05). Besides the main power law continuum, the second relevant spectral component in this model is a relativistically smeared reflected power law, which is thought to be produced in an ionized accretion disk. We fitted the spectrum with Xspec (Arnaud 1996) version 12.0, and we used PHABS to account for the Galactic hydrogen column density along the line of sight. We used REFLIONX  to model the reflected component, and we left the ionization parameter of the reflector free to vary. Hence, we accounted for the relativistic effects from an accretion disk surrounding a rotating black hole (Laor 1991) with KDBLUR2. The free parameters in this component are the disk inclination and inner radius, along with the slopes and the break radius of the broken power law shaped emissivity profile. We kept the outer radius frozen to the default value of 400 gravitational radii (R g ), and we set the iron abundance to the solar value (Anders & Grevesse 1989). We extended the model calculation to a larger energy range (0.1-40 keV) to avoid spurious effect due to a trun-  Table 1). Note that the data point labeled with a "X" has not been used in the present analysis (see Sect. 3.1).

cated convolution. We also attempted to fit the spectrum with a composite disk model (see F05), splitting the disk in two regions with different ionization, to mimic a more realistic scenario where the disk ionization parameter varies with the radius. However, with a simple reflection model we already obtained a statistically good fit, that was not strikingly improved (∆C = 29) using a more complex composite disk model. We list the best fit parameters of the reflection fitting in Table 3. Overall, our result agrees with the main predictions of the physical picture proposed in F05. The black hole hosted in 1H 0419-577 may be rapidly spinning as suggested by the proximity of the fitted disk inner radius to the value of the innermost stable orbit of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole. The steep emissivity profile of the disk indicates that it is illuminated mostly in its inner part, as it is expected if the primary continuum is emitted very close to the BH. In this framework, the historical source variability is due to the variable light bending, which may produce a negative trend of the reflection fraction with the power law flux. Our results are consistent with the general trend noticed in F05 (Fig. 3).


Broadband spectral modeling

The AGN emission can be also produced by thermal Comptonization (see Sect. 1). This model has the advantage of explaining AGN emission in a consistent way over the entire optical, UV, and X-ray energy range (e.g. Mrk 509, M11, P13). Indeed, the disk blackbody temperature that can be constrained from a fit of the optical/UV data serves as input for the Comptonized components that produce the X-ray continuum. The model includes both a warm (hereafter labeled as "wc") and a hot Comptonizing corona (hereafter labeled as "hc") to cover the entire X-ray bandpass. Given the simultaneous X-ray, UV and optical coverage available in the present case, it is worthwhile testing also this scenario. We fitted the EPIC-pn spectrum of 1H 0419-577 together with the COS, FUSE and OM count-rates with SPEX. We left the nor-malization of each instrument relative to the EPIC-pn as a free parameter to account for the diverse collecting area of different detectors. In the fit we both accounted for the Galactic absorption and for the local warm absorber that we detected in Paper I. For the former, we used the SPEX collisionally-ionized plasma model (HOT), setting a low temperature (0.5 eV) to mimic a neutral gas. The cosmological redshift (z=0.104) was also considered in the fit. The final multicomponent model is plotted in Fig. 4. We used the disk-blackbody model (DBB) in SPEX to model the optical-UV emission of 1H 0419-577. This model is based on a geometrically thin, optically thick, Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk (Shakura 1973). The DBB spectral shape results from the weighed sum of the different blackbody spectra emitted by annuli of the disk located at different radii. The free parameters are the maximum temperature in the disk (T max ) and the normalization A = R 2 in cos i, where R in is the inner radius of the disk and i is the disk inclination. We kept instead the ratio between the outer and the inner radius of the disk frozen to the default value of 10 3 . The parameters of the disk-blackbody best fitting the data (Fig. 4, long dashed line) are: T max = 56 ± 6 eV and A = (1.2 ± 0.6) × 10 26 cm 2 . The fitted intercalibration factors between OM, COS and FUSE and EPIC-pn, with errors, are reported in Table 2. The effect of these intercalibration corrections is within the errors of the disk blackbody parameters given above.

We used the COMT model in SPEX, which is based on the Comptonization model of Titarchuk (1994), to model the X-ray continuum. The seed photons in this model have a Wien-law spectrum with temperature T 0 . In the fit we coupled T 0 to the disk temperature T max . The other free parameters are the electron temperature T and the optical depth τ of the Comptonizing plasma. A combination of two Comptonizing components fits the entire EPIC-pn spectrum. The warm corona (T wc ∼ 0.7 keV) is optically thick (τ wc ∼ 7) and produces the softer part of the X-ray continuum, below ∼2.0 keV (Fig. 4, dotted line). On the other hand, the hot corona (T hc ∼ 160 keV) is optically thin (τ hc ∼ 0.5) and accounts for the X-ray emission above ∼2 keV (Fig. 4, dashed line). Hence, we identified the remaining features in the model residuals as due to the O vii-O viii (Fig. 4, dash dot line) and Fe Kα emission lines (Fig. 4, dash dot dot line). We added to the fit a broadened Gaussian line, with the line-centroid and the linewidth frozen to the values that we obtained in the RGS fit (Paper I) to account for the O vii emission. The fitted line luminosity is consistent with what reported in Paper I. The shallower O viii line that was present in the RGS spectrum is instead undetected in the EPIC data. In a Comptonization framework, a possible origin for the Fe Kα emission is reflection from a cold, distant matter (e.g., from the torus). We have shown in Sect. 4.1 that the Fe Kα line in 1H 0419-577 might also be broad. Detailed study of the properties of the Fe Kα emission line produced in cold matter show that in some conditions the line may appear broadened because of the blend between the main line core and the so-called "Compton shoulder" (see e.g., Yaqoob & Murphy 2011). The predicted apparent line broadening is consistent with what we have obtained in Sect 4.1 from a phenomenological fit of a possible line-width. We added a REFL component to the fit to test this possibility. We considered an incident power law with a cutoff energy of 150 keV, and with the same slope and normalization that we derived from the phenomenological fit (Sect. 4.1). We set a null ionization parameter and a low gas temperature (T ∼ 1 eV) to mimic a neutral reflector and, to adapt the model to the data, we left only the scaling factor 2 (s) free to vary. A reflected component with s = 0.3 ± 0.1 satisfactorily fits the Fe Kα line and slightly adjusts the underlying continuum (∆C = −7). We list the luminosities of all the model components in Table 4 while the parameters and errors of the Comptonized components are outlined in Table 5.
