Materials and Methods

Mice. 6-8-wk-old females were used in all experiments and were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions. B10.BR, B6.SJL (CD45.1), and B6/MRL (Fas lpr) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. 3A9 transgenic mice were maintained by crossing with B10.BR mice. To obtain CD45.1 3A9 or 3A9/lpr T cells, B6.SJL or B6/MRL mice were crossed extensively with 3A9 mice and tested for CD45.1 and I-A k , by flow cytometry. Fas lpr mutation was tested by PCR. Mice were injected subcutaneously with peptide in CFA and subcutaneously or intravenously with chimeric antibodies. All experiments with mice were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Flow Cytometry and Antibodies Used for Staining. CD4-(L3T4), MHC II-(10-3.6), CD11c-(HL3), CD11c-(HL3), B220-(RA3-6B2), or CD3-(145-2C11), CD80(B7-1)-(16-10A1) I-A k -(10-3.6) CD45.1-(A20), Il-2-(JES6-5H4), IFN-␥ -(XMG1.2), CD40-(HM40-3-FITC), CD86(B7-2)-(GL1) specific antibodies were from BD PharMingen. Rat IgG-PE (goat anti-rat IgG) specific antibody was from Serotec. 3A9 T cell receptor (1G12)specific antibody was a gift from Dr. Emil Unanue, Washington University, St. Louis, MO (18).

For visualization of rat IgGs on surface of mononuclear cells, lymphoid cells were purified from peripheral LNs 14 h after antibody injection and stained with anti-rat IgG-RPE (goat anti-rat IgG-RPE; Serotec) to visualize surface bound NLDC145 and GL117 antibodies. The cells were then incubated in mouse serum to block nonspecific binding and stained with FITC anti-CD11c (HL3), or -B220 (RA3-6B2), or -CD3 (145-2C11).

For intracellular cytokine staining, lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro for 4 h with leukocyte activation cocktail (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using cytofix/cytoperm buffer from BD PharMingen.

Immunohistology. Popliteal LNs were removed from antibody injected mice and 5-m cryosections (Microm; ZEISS) were prepared. Tissue specimens were fixed in acetone (5 min, room temperature [RT]) air dried, and stained in a moist chamber. The injected antibodies were detected by incubating the sections with streptavidin Cy3 or streptavidin-FITC (Jackson Immunotech). In double labeling experiments, the PE-conjugated antibodies were added for additional 30 min. Specimens were examined using a fluorescence microscope and confocal optical sections of ‫ف‬ 0.3-m thickness were generated using deconvolution software (Metamorph).

Constructing and Production of Hybrid Antibodies. Total RNA was prepared from NLDC-145 (19) and GLII7 (gift of R.J. Hodes, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) hybridomas (both rat IgG2a) using Trizol (GIBCO BRL). Full-length Ig cDNAs were produced with 5 Ј -RACE PCR kit (GIBCO BRL) using primers specific for 3 Ј -ends of rat IgG2a and Ig kappa. The V regions were cloned in frame with mouse Ig kappa constant regions and IgG1 constant regions carrying mutations that interfere with FcR binding (20). DNA coding for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) peptide 46-61 with spacing residues on both sides was added to the C terminus of the heavy chain using synthetic oligonucleotides. Gene specific primers for cloning of rat IgG2a and Ig kappa:

Hybrid antibodies were transiently expressed in 293 cells after transfection using calcium-phosphate. Cells were grown in serum-free DMEM supplemented with Nutridoma SP (Boehringer). Antibodies were purified on Protein G columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentrations of purified antibodies were determined by ELISA using goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Jackson Immunotech).

Cell Culture and Proliferation Assays. Pooled axillary, brachial, inguinal, and popliteal LNs were dissociated in 5% FCS RPMI and incubated in presence of collagenase (Boehringer) and EDTA as described (21). For antigen presentation CD19 ϩ and CD11c ϩ cells were purified using microbeads coupled to anti-mouse CD11c or CD19 IgG (Miltenyi Biotec) and irradiated with 1,500 rad. CD4 T cells were purified by depletion using rat antibodies supernatants specific for mouse: CD8 (TIB 211), B220 (RA3-6B2), MHC II (M5/114, TIB 120), F4/80 (F4/80), and magnetic beads coupled to anti-rat IgG (Dynal). In antigen loading experiments the isolated presenting cells from each experimental group were cultured in 96-well plates with 2 ϫ 10 5 purified 3A9 CD4 ϩ T cells. Cultures were maintained for 48 h with [ 3 H]thymidine (1 Ci) added for the last 6 h. The results were calculated as a ratio of proliferation in experimental groups to a PBS control group. The proliferation in PBS controls ranged from 500 to 2,000 cpm.

For T cell proliferation assays in adoptive transfer recipients, 9 ϫ 10 4 of the same irradiated CD11c ϩ cells isolated from spleens of wild-type B10.BR mice were cultured in 96-well plates with 3 ϫ 10 5 T cells from each experimental group. Synthetic HEL peptide, at final concentration of 100 g/ml, was added to half of the cultures. Cultures were maintained for 24 h with [ 3 H]thymidine (1 Ci/ml) added for the last 6 h. Response to HEL peptide was determined by subtracting background (no HEL peptide added) proliferation from proliferation in the presence of HEL peptide. Proliferation index was calculated as the ratio of the response to HEL peptide in a given experimental group to the response to HEL of T cells from a PBS-injected control. Proliferation in PBS groups ranged from 4,000-8,000 cpm in the presence of peptide and the response to HEL peptide in these PBS controls was 1,000-3,000 counts above the background. Synthetic HEL 46-61 peptide was provided by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Keck Biotechnology Resource Center.

Adoptive Transfer. CD4 cells from 3A9 mice were enriched by depletion as described above, washed 3 ϫ with PBS, and 5 ϫ 10 6 cells injected intravenously per mouse. Alternatively, before depletion total cells were labeled with 2 M 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester (CFSE) in 5% FCS RPMI (Molecular Probes) at 37 Њ C for 20 min and washed twice.
