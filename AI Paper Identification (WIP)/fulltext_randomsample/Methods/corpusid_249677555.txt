All chemicals were purchased from commercially available sources and, if not stated otherwise, used without further purification. Flame dried or oven-dried glassware was used for all reactions under argon atmosphere along with standard Schlenk techniques. Dry dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran were received from an MBRAUN MB SPS-800. The solvents were distilled and dried over 4 Å molecular sieve and finally dried on an alox column. Other dry solvents were dried with flame dried 4 Å molecular sieve. Residual water was determined by a Karl Fischer Titroline® 7500KF trace. Merck TLC aluminum sheets (silica gel 60, F254) were used for thinlayer chromatography. Substances were detected by fluorescence under UV light (wavelength λ = 254 nm). Column chromatography was performed with silica gel (grain size 0.04-0.063 mm, Merck Si60) and distilled solvents. 1 H NMR spectra, as well as 13 C, were recorded with a Bruker AVIII 300 and a Bruker AVIII 400 spectrometer at room temperature. 19 F NMR were recorded with a Bruker DPX 250 spectrometer at room temperature and were measured proton decoupled if not further noted. ESI-MS spectra were recorded with a Thermo LTQ XL Orbitrap or a Waters Vion with compounds dissolved in acetonitrile or dichloromethane. IR spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu IR Affinity-IS spectrometer. For stock solutions, a Mettler Toledo XSR 105 Dual Range balance was used to weight starting material.

General NMR scale procedure for the Povarov [4 + 2] cycloaddition: In a dried NMR tube, 200 μL of a 150 mM stock solution of N-benzylidene aniline (1) (29.9 μmol, 5.41 mg, 1.00 equiv.) with 0.125 equiv. tetraethylsilane, 200 μL of a 300 mM stock solution of 2,3-dihydrofuran (2) (58.9 μmol, 4.51 μL, 4.19 mg, 2.00 equiv.) and 100 μL of a 15.0 mM stock solution of the respective catalyst (1.50 μmol, 0.05 equiv.) were mixed. The NMR tube was thoroughly shaken and periodical 1 H NMR measurements were taken. The yield of the corresponding product was determined as follows: The tetraethylsilane quartet was integrated and set to 1. Afterwards, the integrals of the characteristic signals for product 3 at 5.21 ppm (endo diastereomer) and 4.55 ppm (exo diastereomer) as well as the N=CH signal of 1 at 8.48 ppm and the formed benzaldehyde at 10.02 ppm were added. 100 was divided by this sum. This value was then multiplied by the sum of the integrals for product 3, giving the overall yield of 3.

General asymmetric catalysis procedure for the Povarov [4 + 2] cycloaddition: To a flame-dried Schlenk tube with a septum, 400 μL of a 250 mM stock solution of N-Benzylidene-p-toluidine (17) (100 μmol, 19.5 mg, 1.00 equiv.) were added and cooled to À 55°C. After 10 minutes, 400 μL of a 50.0 mM stock solution of the respective catalyst (20.0 μmol, 0.20 equiv.) were added. After another 10 minutes, 200 μL of a 1.00 M stock solution of 2,3dihydrofuran (2) (200 μmol, 15,1 μL, 14.0 mg, 2.00 equiv.) were added. The mixture was stirred for 72 h at À 55°C and then quenched with 14.0 μL triethylamine (1.00 eq). After warming to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography using pentane : ethyl acetate 10 : 1 (R f = 0.52 (exo), R f = 0.48 (endo)). The obtained diastereomeric mixture was analyzed by chiral HPLC using a Dr. Maisch ReproSil Chiral-OM 5 μm column, 1.5 mL/min flow rate with hexane:isopropanol 96 : 4 (retention times: 5.75 min and 13.72 min for the exo-enantiomers, 8.12 min and 11.05 min for the endoenantiomers). The spectroscopic data of the diastereomeric mixtures are in agreement with the literature. [26a]
