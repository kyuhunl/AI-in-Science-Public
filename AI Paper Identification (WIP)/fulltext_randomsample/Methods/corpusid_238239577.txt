EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing the various ZBTB7A constructs that encoded the various ZF regions and an N-terminal FLAG tag expressed via pcDNA3. Recombinant ZBTB7A fragments were purified from expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3).


METHOD DETAILS

Protein expression and Purification-The C2H2 zinc finger coding region of human ZBTB7A (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001304919.1; residues 382-506) with an additional tryptophan at the end of C terminus was amplified by PCR from the bone marrow cDNA library, then cloned into a modified pGEX-4T1 vector (GE Healthcare) with a TEV protease cleavage site after the GST tag (pGEX-4T1-TEV), further verified by DNA sequencing.

The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) that were cultured at 37°C in LeMaster and Richards minimal medium (LR medium), supplemented with 0.1 mM ZnSO 4 . When OD 600 reached to 1.0, the cultured medium was shifted to 16°C and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 20 h. The cells were resuspended in the 1M NaCl Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 M NaCl) supplemented with 1 tablet/1 mL protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and DNAaseI (20U; Thermo Scientific), and lysed by high-pressure cell disrupter. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 6 h and eluted with 30 mM reduced glutathione in the 1M NaCl buffer, then cleaved in the 0.4M NaCl buffer by TEV protease overnight at 4°C to remove GST tag. The tag cleaved proteins were then purified using size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in the 1M NaCl buffer. The purified proteins were dialyzed and concentrated in 0.15M NaCl or 0.3M NaCl buffer for respectively subsequent crystallization or ITC experiments.

In parallel, the fragments of human ZBTB7A (residues 370-500, pXC2222; residues 380-494, pXC2238; and residues 380-500, pXC2243) were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector with a GST fusion tag. All three plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon-plus (DE3)-RIL. Bacteria was grown in LB broth at 37°C until reaching the log phase (OD 600nm between 0.4 and 0.5), the shake temperature was set to 16°C and 25 μM ZnCl 2 was added to the cell culture. When the shake temperature reached 16°C and OD 600nm reached ~0.8, addition of 0.2 mM IPTG induced the expression for 20 h at 16°C. Cell harvesting and protein purification were carried out at 4°C through a three-column chromatography protocol, conducted in a BIO-RAD NGC ™ system. Cells were collected by centrifugation and pellet was suspended in the lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethl)phosphine (TCEP), supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl and 25 μM ZnCl 2 . Cells were lysed by sonication and 0.3% (w/v) polyethylenimine was slowly titrated into the cell lysate before centrifugation (Patel et al., 2016a). The debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 47,000 g and the supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL GSTrap column (GE Healthcare). The resin was washed by the lysis buffer and bound protein was eluted in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP and 20 mM glutathione (reduced form). The proteins were digested with PreScission protease (produced in-house) to remove the GST fusion tag. The cleaved proteins were loaded onto a 5 mL Heparin column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted by NaCl gradient from 0.25 to 1M in the lysis buffer. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex S200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 0.25M NaCl supplemented lysis buffer. The proteins were frozen and stored at −80°C.

Binding assays of protein-nucleic acids interaction-We used three binding assays to characterize the binding affinity of ZBTB7A to oligodeoxynucleotides: (i) EMSA, (ii) fluorescence polarization (FP) (Moerke, 2009;Patel et al., 2016a) and (iii) isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Gontier et al., 2021).

The EMSA experiments were carried out as previously described (Crossley et al., 1996). Briefly, the sense oligonucleotide 5′-TGG GGG CCC CTT CCC CAC ACT AT-3′ was labeled with [γ− 32 P] triphosphate using T4 polynucleotide kinase by incubating at 37°C for 30 min then boiling for 1 min at 100°C. The unlabeled antisense strand was annealed via slow cooling from 100°C to room temperature. The radiolabeled probes were purified using the Quick Spin Columns for radiolabeled DNA Purification Kit. Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing constructs that encoded the various ZF regions of ZBTB7A and an N-terminal FLAG tag expressed from pcDNA3. A pcDNA3 "empty" COS-7 lane was used as a negative control to show binding of any endogenous background proteins to the probe. Each lane contained 5 μL of nuclear extract (approximately 5 μg of protein) and 1 μL of radiolabeled probe. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 4°C before being loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). Gels were run at 250 V for 1 h 45 min at 4°C and dried using a Bio-Rad vacuum heated gel dryer (80°C for 30-45 min). Gels were visualized using the Typhoon FLA 9500 Laser Scanner following overnight exposure to a Fujifilm BAS Cassette 2025 phosphor screen.

The FP experiments were used to measure the binding affinity with Synergy 4 Microplate Reader (BioTek). Aliquots (5 nM) of 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA duplex (FAM-5′-TGT GGG GAA GGG GCC-3′ and 3′-CAC CCC TTC CCC GG-5′) was incubated in 20 μL with varied amount of proteins (0 to 2.5 μM) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 225 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a black opaque 384-well plate before measurement. The data were processed using Graph-pad prim ( The ITC experiments were performed on a Microcal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern) at 20°C. HPLC grade single-stranded oligonucleotides in powder form was dissolved to 100 μM with 0.15 M NaCl or 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, mixed with equal molar and incubated at 95°C for 5 min in a metal bath and slowly cooling to room temperature. The concentration of proteins (300-400 μM) and DNA oligos (to 20 μM) in the same buffer were determined spectrophotometrically. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were diluted to the target concentration and were loaded with 200 μL into sample cell, whereas the proteins were loaded with 40 μL into syringe. The titration protocol was the same for all the measurements, which were composed of a single initial injection of 1 μL protein, followed by 19 injections of 2 μL protein into DNA samples, the intervals between injections was set to 150 s and a reference power is 5 μcal s −1 . Curves fitting to a single-site binding model were performed by MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software provided by the manufacturer and summarized in Table S2.

Crystallography-The protein-DNA complex was prepared by mixing the purified fragment (residues 382-506) with the double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-ATA GGG CCC CTT CCC AAC-3′ and 3′-ATC CCG GGG AAG GGT TGT-5′ with underlined substitution of C:G to A:T) in a 1:1.2 molar ratio, followed by dialysis in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl overnight. The complex was further purified via size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column and concentrated to ~1.2 mM and 0.5 mM TCEP was added prior to crystallization. The crystals were grown at 293 K via the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μL protein-DNA complex and 1 μL reservoir buffer composed of 0.1 M malonate, imidazole, and boric acid (produced by mixing sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid in the molar ratio of 2:3:3), pH 7.0, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500. The crystals were soaked in cryo-protector made of mother liquor supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray diffraction data of the crystal (PDB 7EYI) was collected on beamline 19U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at a wavelength of 0.979 Å. The diffraction dataset was processed and scaled using the HKL-2000 (Otwinowski et al., 2003). The crystallographic phasing was performed by using the AutoSolve module in the PHENIX (Terwilliger et al., 2009), with the zinc atom sites being found by the SHELX C/D program (Fu et al., 2007). The initial protein model was built using the Buccaneer program in the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Next, the DNA model was further built using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), and refinement was performed using the PHENIX.Refine program (Headd et al., 2012). The Phenix.composite_omit_map program (Headd et al., 2012) was used to generate 2Fo-Fc composite omit electron density maps. All structures in the figures were generated with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC).

In parallel, the ZBTB7A fragment (residues 370-500; 0.9 mM) was mixed with oligonucleotides (annealed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl) with molar ratio 1:1. Crystals were flash frozen using 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol as the cryo-protector. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at SER-CAT 22-ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory utilizing X-ray beams at 1.0 Å wavelength and processed by HKL2000. Molecular replacement was performed with the PHENIX PHASER program utilizing the two-finger module (ZF1 and ZF2) of PDB 7N5U as the search model and further model building commenced with COOT. The initial electron density showed recognizable molecular features of the β sheets and α helices of the zinc fingers and helical DNA. Manual building proceeded in COOT to build protein and the DNA duplex. COOT was also utilized for corrections between PHENIX refinement rounds. In all three structures, the C-terminal residues beyond amino acid 491 were disordered.
