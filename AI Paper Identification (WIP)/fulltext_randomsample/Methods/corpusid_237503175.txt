Materials and Methods


Preparation of P. lobata Extract. PE was provided by

Sejun F & B Co., Ltd. (Gangwon, Korea). It was in the form of a spray-dried powder, which was prepared as follows. To separate the starch, dried P. lobate was soaked in 50% ethanol for 1 h and then centrifuged. e residue of P. lobate was extracted in five volumes of 50% ethanol for 1 h at 60°C. e extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. e PE was powdered in the spray drying system by mixing 30% dextrin. e content of puerarin, which is a major isoflavone in PE, was 42.38 mg/g.


Animals and Treatment.

Nine-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats, which were ovariectomized or sham-operated at 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Chemon Inc. (Gyeonggido, Korea) and maintained under controlled laboratory conditions (23°C ± 1°C, humidity 55% ± 5%, 12 h light/dark cycle) for 2 weeks before the experiments. e rats were randomly divided into the following treatment groups (n � 8 per group): (1) sham group, (2) OVX group, (3) OVX + PE 25 mg/kg group, (4) OVX + PE 100 mg/kg group, (5) OVX + PE 400 mg/kg group, and (6) OVX + PE 1600 mg/kg group. All animal experiment protocols in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Hongcheon Institute of Medicinal Herb (No. 19-07). PE was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for oral administration at the desired dose in a volume of 5 mL/kg once daily for 8 weeks. e food intake and body weight of rats were measured twice a week. After 16 h of fasting on the last day of the experiment, blood was collected from the portal vein. e uterus and white adipose tissue were collected and weighed.


Biochemical Parameters.

e plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the collected blood in heparinized tubes (4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C) and then stored at −80°C for assay. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Ca, P, total cholesterol (TC), highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured using an automated clinical chemistry analyser (Konelab 20XT; ermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Free fatty acid (FFA; BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA), insulin, estradiol (E2), and serotonin levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Cusabio, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.


Liver Lipid Peroxidation Assay.

e liver sample (120 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL of PBS and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. e supernatant obtained was used a source for the assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay according to the manufacturer's (Dogenbio, Seoul, Korea) instructions.


Bone Turnover Markers in Plasma Samples.

e bone formation marker Osteocalcin (OC) was determined using a rat osteocalcin ELISA kit (Cusabio). e bone resorption markers, such as C-terminal telopeptide fragment of type I collagen (CTX-1; Cusabio), deoxypyridinoline (DPD; Cusabio), and pyridinoline (PYD; MyBioSource, San Diego, USA), were determined using commercial ELISA kits.


Immunoblot Analysis.

e total protein in the uterus was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. Equal amounts of protein (15 μg) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and then transferred on to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. e membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and then probed with specific primary antibodies at a final dilution of 1 : 1000. e immunoreactive protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection kit (Clarity Max TM Western ECL Substrate; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and visualized using the Chemidoc Touch image system (ChemiDoc TM XRS + system; Bio-Rad Laboratories).


Histological Analysis.

e uterus samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. e tissue sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. e static parameters of the uterus, endometrial, myometrial, and epithelial lengths were calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).


Statistical

Analysis. All data are expressed as mean-± standard error of the mean (SEM). ey were analysed using the analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.05.
