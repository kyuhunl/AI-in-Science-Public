METHODS

WES, RNA-seq, and Bioinformatic Analysis Exome capture was performed using SureSelect Human All Exon V5+UTRs in-solution capture reagents (Agilent). One and one-half micrograms of genomic DNA was sheared sonically to 150-200 bp (paired-end) insert size with a Covaris S2 device. Two hundred and fifty nanograms of Illumina adapter-containing library was hybridized with exome baits at 65°C for 16 h. Paired-end sequencing (101 bp) was performed with a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) in a rapid mode. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina). Briefly, mRNA was purified from 1 µg total RNA using oligo(dT) beads, poly(A) + RNA was fragmented to 150 bp and converted into cDNA, and cDNA fragments were end-repaired, adenylated on the 3 ′ end, adapter-ligated, and amplified with 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction. The final libraries were validated using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 101 bp) was performed with a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) in a rapid mode. Sequencing data were analyzed using a previously reported bioinformatics workflow (Kordes et al. 2016; see Table 2 for coverage metrics).


Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Data Set

Breast cancer data sets (study brca_tcga_pub2015) including data on DNA copy number status (GISTIC) and mRNA expression (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) of PDL1 were retrieved from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal) and analyzed as described previously (Budczies et al. 2016). Immunohistochemistry data for ER, PR, and HER2 as well as FISH data for HER2 were retrieved from the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov). The study cohort comprised 937 breast carcinomas with available copy number data. Cases were classified into molecular subtypes: 597 (63.7%) HR + /HER2 − tumors, 145 (15.5%) HR + /HER2 + tumors, 38 HR − /HER2 + tumors (4.1%), and 157 (16.8%) HR − /HER2 − tumors. RNA-seq data were available for 934 of these tumors.


Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded whole-tissue slides using a BenchMark XT device (Ventana Medical Systems) according to quality-controlled standard procedures. After antigen retrieval, the following primary antibodies were used: AE1/3: 1:100 dilution, DAKO (#M3515); GATA3: ready to use, Ventana (#760-4897); CK7: 1:50 dilution, DAKO (#M7018); PDL1: 1:100 dilution, Spring (#07309457001); CD4 mouse monoclonal antibody: 1:20 dilution, Novocastra/Leica (clone 1F6); napsin: 1:400 dilution, Novacastra/Leica (clone IP64, #NCL-L-Napsin A); TTF1: 1:100 dilution, Novocastra/Leica (clone SPT24, #NCL-L-TTF1). Either 3,3 ′ -diaminoenzidine peroxide substrate or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole served as chromogens.

FISH using a commercially available dual color probe for the PDL1 (CD274) gene (Zytovision; # Z-2179-200) was performed on whole slides according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four-micrometer-thick sections were cut, mounted on SuperFrost slides, and deparaffinized. The PDL1 probe was labeled with a green fluorochrome and the classical satellite III region of Chromosome 9 (CEN9, D9Z3) was labeled with an orange fluorochrome.
