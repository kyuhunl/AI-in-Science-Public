MATERIALS AND METHODS


Animals and Housing

All studies were performed using 8-week-old and 42-45-weekold CD-1 R (ICR) female mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Beijing, China). Mice were housed in ventilated cages on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on from 08: 00 to 20: 00) under controlled temperature (22 ± 2 • C) with freely available food and water. The mice were allowed to adapt to conditions for 7 days before the initiation of experiments. In this experiment, 42-45-week-old female mice nearly at the end of their reproductive lifespan were used as a natural aging model.


Chemicals and Antibodies

All chemicals and drugs were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated. The anti-pERM antibody (#3726), anti-pMRLC antibody (#3675), and anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab')2 Fragment (Alexa Fluor R 594 Conjugate) secondary antibody (#8889) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Cell Signaling, USA). The anti-alpha Tubulin antibody (62204) was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The Fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated Affinipure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (SA00003-2) was purchased from Proteintech (Proteintech Group, Inc.).


Experimental Design

8-week-old young mouse oocytes were regarded as young group. 42-45-week-old aged mouse oocytes were randomly assigned to aged and PCB2-supplemented groups. Procyanidin B2 (PCB2) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL with M16 or M2 medium, respectively. The youth group served as the control and received no treatment. The in vitro matured oocytes were randomly divided into three groups as follows: (1) young group: oocytes obtained from 8-week-old mice matured in vitro; (2) aged group: oocytes obtained from 42 to 45-week-old mice matured in vitro; (3) aged+PCB2 group: oocytes obtained from 42 to 45-week-old mice matured in vitro and treated with 5 µg/mL PCB2.


Oocyte Collection

The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 46-48 h after intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Ningbo Hormone Product Co. Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China). Fully-grown GV oocytes were collected by removing cumulus cells in a drop of M2 medium supplemented with dbcAMP (100 ng/mL) through repeatedly pipetting. Fully-grown GV oocytes were cultured in M16 medium under mineral oil at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 incubator.


Immunofluorescence Staining (IF) and Confocal Microscopy

Oocytes were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 40 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1h. After being blocked in 3% BSA for 1h at room temperature, oocytes/embryos were incubated with different primary antibodies (anti-pERM, 1:600; anti-pMRLC, 1:300; anti-α-tubulin, 1:8000; anti-β-tubulin, 1:100) overnight at 4 • C. The oocytes were further incubated with FITC-conjugated Affinipure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, all oocytes were stained with 4 ′ ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min at room temperature, then oocytes were mounted on glass slides and the fluorescent images were taken with a laser scanning confocal microscopy (A1 Cell Imaging System; Nikon) under the same staining procedure and confocal microscopy parameters. Mean fluorescence intensity per unit area within the region of interest was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of each oocyte.


Intracellular ROS Level Assay

Denuded oocytes were added to the medium which contains 1
mmol/L 2 ′ , 7 ′ -dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (DCFHDA)
for measuring ROS at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 for 20 min. Then oocytes were washed by M2 three times. The fluorescence was examined under an epifluorescence microscope with a filter at 460-nm excitation for ROS (IX73; Olympus). The fluorescence of each oocyte was analyzed by EZ-C1Free-Viewer (Nikon).


Statistical Analysis

In all experiments, data were analyzed using SPSS software v.21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Student's t-test was performed for statistical analysis. For abnormal spindle and chromosome alignment, chi-square test was performed for statistical analysis. Unless otherwise stated, * = P < 0.05, * * = P < 0.01, * * * = P < 0.001, ns = non-significant difference (P > 0.05).
