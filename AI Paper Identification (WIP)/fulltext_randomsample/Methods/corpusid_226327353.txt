TRANSPARENT METHODS


Specimen Collection

Peripheral blood samples from anonymous healthy donors (with unknown allergy status) were obtained from the Stanford Blood Center (Palo Alto, CA, USA) via venipuncture in heparin-or EDTA-coated tubes and stored at 4°C for no more than 24 hours.

Healthy bone marrow and peripheral blood samples paired from the same donor were ordered from AllCells (Alameda, CA, USA) and delivered and processed the same day.

Samples from patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were collected for diagnosis in EDTA or heparin tubes and stored at 4°C. Research aliquots were obtained <3 days after collection as postdiagnostic excess material under IRB-30899 and IRB-40765.


Antibodies

A summary of all mass cytometry antibodies, reporter isotopes and concentrations used for analysis is displayed in Table S1. Except for CD3-QDot 655 (Invitrogen), primary conjugates of mass cytometry antibodies were prepared 200 μg at a time using the MaxPAR antibody conjugation kit (Fluidigm Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. After metal-labeling, antibodies were diluted in PBS-based Antibody Stabilization Solution (Boca Scientific) supplemented with 0.02% sodium azide to 0.2 mg/mL and stored long-term at 4°C. Each antibody clone and lot was titrated to optimal staining concentrations using human peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples.


Stimulation of Basophils

One milliliter aliquots of whole blood were distributed into round-bottom tubes with loose lids and warmed in a 37°C water bath for 30 seconds. Freshly prepared, 1 mL aliquots of pre-warmed RPMI 1640 (Gibco) were supplemented with polyclonal rabbit anti-IgE (Bethyl Laboratories) or IL-3 (PeproTech). The prewarmed 1 mL of whole blood was then mixed with either 1 mL of RPMI 1640, or RPMI 1640 supplemented with anti-IgE (final concentration, 1 μg/mL) or IL-3 (final concentration, 2 ng/mL) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the incubation period, red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis with 20 mL of cold RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend) and incubation for 15 minutes on ice. The lysis reaction was stopped with PBS supplemented with EDTA (Invitrogen Life Technologies; final concentration, 2 mM) followed by centrifugation at 250g for 5 minutes at 4°C (all centrifuge runs on live cells were done with these conditions).


Mass Cytometry Basophil Staining

Cells were resuspended in cell staining medium (CSM; low barium PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide) and blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) following the manufacturer's instructions. The corresponding surface antibody cocktail (Table S1) was then added yielding a 100 μL reaction volume and stained at room temperature for 30 minutes. Following surface staining, 1 mL of low barium PBS supplemented with Carboplatin (Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration, 0.5 μM) was added to the cell suspension as a viability stain and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. To stop the reaction, tubes were washed twice with cell staining medium. Following the wash steps, cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature with formaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) at a final concentration of 1.6% (diluted in cell staining medium). Cells were then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C and washed once with cell staining medium prior to permeabilization with 4°C methanol for at 10 min at 4°C. Following cell permeabilization, cells were then washed twice in cell staining media and then stained with an intracellular antibody cocktail (see Table S1) in 100 μL at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed with cell staining medium, stained overnight at 4°C with 1 mL of 1:4000 191/193 iridium DNA intercalator (Fluidigm Sciences), and diluted in low barium PBS with PFA at a final concentration of 1.6%. Prior to acquiring cells on the CyTOF2 mass cytometer (Fluidigm Sciences), cells were washed once with 4°C cell staining medium and twice with double-deionized water (ddH2O). Washed samples were then resuspended in ddH2O containing 1:10 dilution of EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm Sciences). Cells were acquired at an event rate of less than 500 cells per second.


Mass cytometry data processing

After cell acquisition, FCS files for each sample were processed through a MATLAB-based beadnormalization software (Finck et al., 2013) before being uploaded to Cytobank (Kotecha et al., 2010) for gating . All parameters except for time and cell length were displayed with an arcsinh transformation. As seen in Figure 1, events positive for intercalator-Ir were selected as having high DNA content. Cisplatin was then used to discriminate live from dead cells. Staining with CD235ab allowed exclusion of red blood cells from proceeding gates. Cells that exhibited high and medium levels of CD45 were then analyzed. Gating strategy plots for eosinophils (CD45 + HLA-DR -CD123 -CD14 -CD66b + Siglec-8 + ), neutrophils (CD45 + HLA -DR -CD123 -CD14 -CD66b + CD16 + ) and basophils (CD45 + HLA-DR -CD123 + ) using classic lineage markers. We back-gated to make sure that none of the cells belonged in multiple gates.

Dimensionality reduction analyses were first conducted with viSNE in Cytobank, which uses the Barnes-Hut implementation of the tSNE algorithm. In order to compare multiple donors on the same dimensionality reduced plot, we downloaded a subset of the gated PGB data that contained a consistent antibody panel, and further processed with R (http://www.r-project.org) to quantile normalize protein expression by donor to correct for technical variation between CyTOF runs. Furthermore, we transformed the data with an inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) transformation with a cofactor of 5 before employing Scanpy's (Wolf et al., 2018) Python-based (http://www.python.org) implementation.

We used Scanpy to carry out dimensionality reduction via tSNE and clustering with the Leiden algorithm. Up to 1,000 PBG from each of four donors were density sampled and used to generate a tSNE plot based on the expression of the following proteins: CD16, FcεRIα, CD244, CD53, CD305, and CD193. The Leiden algorithm was then used to cluster PGB based on the same proteins previously mentioned ( Figure 1B).


FACS Sorting and Cellular Morphometrics

CD123+ cells were enriched from 10 mL peripheral blood tubes and leukocyte reduction chambers of healthy blood or platelet donors (Stanford Blood Center, Palo Alto, California) after red blood cell lysis and washing with cell staining medium (CSM, PBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.02% NaN3) supplemented with 20 U/mL heparin and 25 U/mL benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich E8263), followed either by using αCD123 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-094-432) on magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, or αCD123-biotin (Miltenyi Biotec 130-098-565) on magnetic streptavidin particles (BD 557812) per manufacturer's instructions. Enriched cells were then stained in a 100 μL reaction with 5 μL CD45 FITC (BioLegend 304006), 5 μL CD123 eFluor 450 (eBioscience 48-1239-41), 5 μL CD244 APC (BioLegend 329511), 1 μL CD16 PE/Cy7 (BioLegend 302015), 1 μL HLA-DR V500 (BD 561225), and 1.5 μL FcεRIα PE (BioLegend 334609), along with 5 μL Fc blocker (BioLegend 422302) and 7-AAD, and sorted on a BD FACS Aria II.

After pre-coating cytofunnels with cell staining medium, sorted populations were cytospun on a Thermo Cytospin 4 at 60 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Additionally, an aliquot of each basophil subpopulation was spotted on a glass plus slide and the cells allowed to settle for 5 minutes. The supernatant was wicked away and the cells fixed with methanol for 5 minutes. All slides were then Wright-Giemsa stained for microscopic imaging. Briefly, slides were stained on an automated stainer for 3 minutes in methanol, 3 minutes in Wright's-Giemsa stain (Beckman Coulter Tru-Color Wright's-Giemsa stain, 7547178), 2 minutes and 30 seconds in stain-buffer combination (50 mL Wright's-Giemsa stain diluted with 90 mL phosphate buffer, pH 6.4), 30 seconds in deionized water, 3 minutes for drying, 1 minute in methanol, 1 minute and 30 seconds in Wright-Giemsa stain, 1 minute in stain-buffer combination, 30 seconds in deionized water, 3 minutes drying. Digital images were taken with a 100x oil objective and Olympus DP22 camera, white balanced and cropped in Adobe Photoshop, and scaled identically. The slides were evaluated by a trained, practicing, board-certified
