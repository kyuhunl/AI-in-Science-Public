Fabrication of Sb 2 WO 6

All chemicals were directly used after purchase without further purification. As per the typical method, 0.1045 g Na 2 WO 4 ·2H 2 O and 0.1446 g SbCl 3 were separately dissolved in 20 mL and 10 mL of distilled water, respectively, and then stirred for 15 min. The Na 2 WO 4 ·2H 2 O solution was added to the SbCl 3 solution until a yellow suspension was formed, after which it was stirred for another 30 min. Next, the solution was added to a microwaveable water kettle (50 mL) and fixed in a microwave hydrothermal synthesizer (XH800, Beijing, China). A continuous microwave heating mode was set up to provide a stable heat source at a microwave power of 500 W. The temperature of the mixed solution quickly rose from room temperature to 160 • C and was maintained at 160 • C for different lengths of time (45 min, 60 min, and 75 min, which were denoted as SWO-45, SWO-60, and SWO-75, respectively). Afterwards, the resulting precipitates were filtered and washed several times with absolute ethanol and deionized water, and then the collected precipitation was dried overnight by lyophilization (LGJ-12, Beijing, China).


Material Characterization

Scanning electron micrographs were collected on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-5610LV, JEOL, Akishima, Japan), and transmission electron micrographs and selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) were collected on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JSM-2100F, 200 kV, Hitachinaka, Naka, Japan) to visually observe morphologies, particle sizes, etc. The crystallographic phase of the as-synthesized samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Cu kα source), and the 2θ-angle ranged from 10 • -80 • . Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were acquired by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at 77 K from a Quadrasorb SI analyzer, and pore size distribution originated from the desorption branch based on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) theory.


Electrochemical Measurements

The electrochemical lithium storage performances were evaluated through a two-electrode system. Specifically, high-purity lithium foil (15.8 mm × 0.5 mm) was employed as the counter and reference electrode. After dissolving carboxymethylcellulose sodium (binder, CMC) in deionized water and stirring gently for 24 h to fabricate the working electrode, the slurry was made by mixing the Sb 2 WO 6 samples, carbon black (Super P), and CMC at a weight ratio of 70:20:10. After fully stirring, the steady slurry was coated onto conductive copper foil and dried at 80 • C for 5 h. The dried electrodes were cut Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1689 3 of 10 into a 12 mm-diameter disk to serve as a working electrode, and the active material loading in each disk was weighed to be 0.9-1.1 mg, corresponding to 0.8-0.97 mg cm −2 . The batteries were assembled in the glove box with argon atmosphere. During assembly, the Celgard 2400 was used as a separator, while the electrolyte was made by dissolving 1M LiPF 6 into a solvent consisting of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC/DMC, 1:1 in volume ratio). The galvanostatic discharge-charge measurements were performed on a LAND CT2001A in the voltage window from 0.01 to 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li + ). An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in the range of 0.01-3.0 V (vs. Li/Li + ) at 0.5 mV s −1 . The two electrochemical tests discussed above were carried out on an electrochemistry workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai, China).  [29]. Furthermore, no additional phase could be found, indicating that pure Sb 2 WO 6 was successfully synthesized. Nanomaterials 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 11 material loading in each disk was weighed to be 0.9 mg-1.1 mg, corresponding to 0.8-0.97 mg cm −2 .

Furthermore, no additional phase could be found, indicating that pure Sb2WO6 was successfully synthesized. The Sb2WO6 samples synthesized by the different microwave heating times (SWO-45, SWO-60, and SWO-75) were also characterized by a nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measurement. As depicted in Figure 1b-d, typical IV-type isotherms were obtained, indicating that almost no micropores existed in the Sb2WO6 samples [36]. A large number of mesopores (whose diameters are usually smaller than 30 nm) were observed in the pore-size distribution curves (inset in Figure 1b The Sb 2 WO 6 samples synthesized by the different microwave heating times (SWO-45, SWO-60, and SWO-75) were also characterized by a nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measurement.
