Observations and data reduction

We have previously used the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) for narrow-band-based searches for galaxies at redshift z ≈ 2 (e.g. Fynbo et al. 1999Fynbo et al. , 2002. Such studies take a long time to prepare as special filters have to be designed and procured for each target. However, we realised that a 63Å-wide filter (named NB391_7) made for other purposes (Sandberg et al. 2015) already exists in the NOT filter set, which by chance is perfectly suited for a study of the z = 2.226 DLA towards Q 1218+0832 (see Fig. 1). In March 2023 we carried out a pilot study (in the sense that we have not reached the detection limit we ultimately would like to reach) of the field using the SDSS g and r filters (g and r hereafter) and the NB391_7 filter in a 3-night observing with the NOT equipped with the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC). One night was lost to bad weather, but we managed to get data on two other nights with clear sky conditions and seeing between 1 and 1.5 arcsec.

We also secured spectroscopic observations of an emission line source discovered in the ALFOSC imaging as described in Sect. 3. Those observations were obtained with the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We used the R1000B grism and a 1.23 arcsec-wide slit providing a resolution of λ/∆λ = 500 and a wavelength coverage of 3600-7770 Å. The spectrum was taken at a high airmass of 2.0, as the object was only observable briefly at the beginning of the night, but otherwise under excellent observing conditions.

The log of observations can be seen in Table 1.  The data from the NOT were reduced and combined using standard procedures for bias subtraction, flat-fielding, and im- age combination implemented in a set of Python scripts. The code for image combination using sigma-clipping is available on GitHub 1 . The combined seeing in the stacked images are 1.3, 1.2, and 1.2 arcsec for g, r, and NB391_7, respectively. Unfortunately, no standard stars were observed on the nights of observation. However, based on the calibration described in Sect. 3, we estimate that the 3-σ detection limit in the narrowband image is 3×10 −17 erg s −1 cm −2 .

The spectroscopic data were reduced using a set of Python scripts for the reduction of long-slit spectra. The code is available on GitHub 2 . The spectrum was wavelength-calibrated using HgAr and Ne arc frames. The spectrum was flux-calibrated using observations of the spectrophotometric standard star Ross640 observed on the same night.

We also analysed public HST observations of the field taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the F814W filter as part of the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey (SLACS) (Bolton et al. 2006). We obtained reduced data from the Hubble Legacy Archive 3 . The 3-σ detection limit in the image is 26.8 mag per arcsec 2 and the point spread function (PSF) has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.113 arcsec.

We note that three asteroids were detected in our NOT broadband images: NR10, OU129, and SA197. All three have welldetermined orbits.
