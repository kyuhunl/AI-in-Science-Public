Materials and Methods

Mice and Cells. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. NLRP3 KO (B6.Nlrp3tm1Vmd) mice were obtained from Kevin Maloy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, and were originally from Vishva Dixit, Genentech, San Francisco, CA. In-house-bred C57BL/6 mice were used as a source of bone marrow cells for generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro. All mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen-free conditions, and all studies were performed in accordance with the ethical standards approved by the Home Office and the University of Oxford. WT and IKKe KO iBMDMs were generated by Jonathan Kagan, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. WT, Tnf −/− ;Tbk1 +/− (TNF/ TBK1 HET) or Tnf −/− Tbk1 −/− (TNF/TBK1 KO) bone marrow was from Cevayir Coban and Michelle Sue Jann Lee, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

In Vivo Peritonitis Model. Either male or female WT or NLRP3 KO mice between 8 and 12 wk old were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher, 10010023) or 1 μg LPS (Sigma, L4391), with or without 10 μg LB-100 (Cambridge Bioscience, L0400). Three hours and 45 min later mice were injected i.p. with either PBS (control) or 200 μL of 25 mM ATP (Sigma, A2383). Four hours after LPS injection (and 15 min after
