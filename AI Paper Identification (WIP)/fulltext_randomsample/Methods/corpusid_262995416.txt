Generation of the -SMA-Cre/R26R transgenic mouse strain

The Cre recombinase cDNA was PCR amplified from the pMCI-13Cre plasmid (a gift from Professor F. Costantini, Department of Genetics, Columbia University, NY, USA) using the following primers: forward 5'-GAAGATCTATGCCCAAGAAGAAGAGGAAGGTGTC-CAATTTACTGAC-3' and reverse 5'-CGGAATTCT-GAACAAACGACCCAAC-3'. The PCR product was then sub-cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the VSMP8 plasmid (a gift of Professor Art Strauch, Dorothy M. Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute, Columbus, OH, USA) which contains the mouse αSMA promoter fragment -1070~+2582, including the first exon and part of first intron (GenBank: U63129 and M57409). The α-SMA promoter-Cre fragment was released from the construct using Sphl and EcoRI for transgenic microinjection (Fig. 1). Transgenic α-SMA-Cre mice were produced by pronuclear injection of the recombinant DNA fragment into fertilized F2 eggs of CBA mice using standard microinjection techniques. Offspring from an α-SMA-Cre-carrying transgenic founder mouse were selected and crossed to the Cre dependent conditional reporter strain R26R+/+ (Rosa26, Soriano P) [15]. α Generation of the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model 5-6 wk old SMA-Cre/R26R mice were endotracheally injected with 80 μl BLM (3 mg/kg in PBS) or with 80 μl PBS (n = 4 for each group). These mice were sacrificed 20 days later for western blot analysis, βgal and immunofluorescent staining.


Tissue β-galactosidase (βgal) staining

Organs were dissected from BLM or PBS treated transgenic mice and subjected to βgal staining. Briefly, organs were fixed in 0.1 M PBS, pH7.3 containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA at 4°C for 1-2 hrs. Left lung lobes were perfused with 1 ml fixing solution by endotracheal injection and right lobes were ligated and removed. Tissues were then incubated in wash buffer (0.1 M PBS, pH7.3 with 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% deoxycholate, 0.02%NP-40) 3 times for 30 min each, and then in staining buffer (0.1 M PBS, pH7.3 with 1 mg/ml βgal, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% deoxycholate, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 6 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 0.02% NP-40) at 37°C overnight. Following staining, wholemount tissues were observed under XTL-3400 Zoom Stereo Microscope (CANY, Shanghai, China) or processed by dehydrating, wax embedding, sectioning at 8 μm intervals and counterstaining with Carmine Alum. Microscopic analyses were performed with a Leica DM LB2 microscope equipped with a digital camera.


Lung histology and immunohistochemistry

After sacrificing α-SMA-Cre/R26R mice, right lung lobes (upper and middle lobes) were dissected and fixed in formalin and processed by conventional histological procedures. After sectioning at 4 μm intervals, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, blocked with 10% goat serum for 60 min at room temperature and immunofluorescently stained with α-SMA, SM-MHC or E-cadherin. Sections were incubated with anti-α-SMA mAb (1:400), antibovine SM-MHC pAb (1:400) or co-incubated with E-cadherin pAb (1:100) overnight at 4°C and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-TRITC (1:800) pAb or goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:400) pAb for 1 hour. DAPI was used to stain nuclei (500 ng/ml in 95% ethanol) for Transgene construction and βgal staining of lung lobes 20 sec, and coverslips were mounted with 80% glycerol. Slides were examined using a Leica DC 500-fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera.

Alternatively, lung sections were processed for Masson's trichrome staining to detect collagen and elastin. The staining was carried out using Masson trichrome staining Kit (Maxim-Bio, Fuzhou, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Western Blot α-SMA protein levels in lungs were evaluated by western blot as previously described [16]. After cytoplasmic protein extraction from the lower lobe of right lung of PBS or BLM-injected mice, protein was quantified using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, USA) and 20 μg was used for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Following electrophoretic transfer, membranes were incubated with anti-α-SMA mAb (1:1000) in TBS/T buffer at 4°C overnight. Membranes were incubated with anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (1:1000), followed by exposure to ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham, UK) and digital scanning in Image station 2000 (Kodak, US). Following α-SMA blotting, films were placed in stripping buffer (50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris. HCI,2%SDS) at 50°C for 30 minutes, washed 5 times, reblocked and reprobed with GAPDH mAb (1:800) and HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Then the membranes went through chemiluminescence as discribed above to detect GAPDH protein in the same film. α-SMA protein levels were measured by densitometry, and expressed relative to GAPDH. Duplicate samples were analyzed for each mouse.


Cell culture and immunofluorescent staining

The human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE-14o (16HBE), a generous gift from Professor S. Holgate (Southampton University, UK) was routinely maintained in growth medium consisting of MEM (Life Technologies, USA) and 10% FCS (Shijiqing Co, China). Cells were seeded into sterile round coverslips placed inside 12-well plates. On reaching 70% confluence, medium was changed to FCS-free MEM, and rhTGF-β1 (R&D company, US) was added to a subset of wells to a final concentration of 10 μg/L. 72 hours later, all wells were washed twice with cold PBS and a subset of wells were fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) at -20°C for 10 min. Coverslips were removed from the wells and placed on glass slides, blocked with 10% goat serum for 60 min. Cells on coverslips were incubated with anti α-SMA mAb (1:400) or rabbit anti human E-cadherin (1:50) overnight at 4°C and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-TRITC (1:800) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:400) for 1 hour. Another subset of wells were fixed with PFA at RT for 20 min and treated with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 5 min. Coverslips were removed from wells, placed on slides, blocked with 10% goat serum for 30 min and incubated with 100 μl Alex 594 phalloidin (1:500) for 20 min at RT. DAPI was used to stain nuclei (500 ng/ml in 95% ethanol) for 20 sec, and coverslips were mounted with 80% glycerol. Slides were examined using a Leica DC 500-fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera.
