Materials and Methods

Crystallization and X-ray structure determination SARS-CoV M pro was produced in large quantities as described. 8,13 Crystals belonging to monoclinic space group P2 1 were grown at pH 6.0 using the published conditions. 13 Under the same conditions, especially at slightly lower pH (5.9) and higher (up to w20%) concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000, a new tetragonal crystal form was observed, often in the same droplets where the monoclinic crystals appeared. An additional screen for improving the crystallization conditions was carried out using the "Anion Suite" of Nextal Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada) and condition no. 36 (1.2 M sodium malonate in 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.5) yielded orthorhombic crystals belonging to space group P2 1 2 1 2. These were optimized at 0.7 M sodium malonate (pH 6.6). This crystal form is similar, if not identical, to the one recently described by Hsu et al. 14 Since coordinates of the structure described by these authors are not yet available, we solved the structure of the orthorhombic crystal form as well. To some crystallization setups, inhibitors were added that had been identified in an in silico screening effort 9 and subsequently synthesized or purchased. In other cases, crystals of the free enzyme were soaked in solutions containing the inhibitor in DMSO. For several of these cases, X-ray structure analysis showed that the inhibitors had not bound to the proteinase. Therefore, the resulting multiple structures of the free enzyme were used to analyze the flexibility of the M pro . Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Joint University of Hamburg/IMB Jena/EMBL synchrotron beamline X13 at DESY, Hamburg, Germany, at a wavelength of w0.80 Å . Intensities were measured by a MarCCD detector and processed using the HKL suite. 24 Crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement and difference Fourier methods, using the original X-ray structure for the SARS-CoV M pro crystallized at pH 6.0 (PDB code 1UJ1 13 ) as the initial model. CNS 25 and, in later stages of refinement, REFMAC 26 were employed for X-ray structure refinement. Electron density interpretation and model building were performed using the computer graphics programs O 27 and XtalView. 28 


Molecular dynamics simulations of the M pro dimer

The starting structures at the different pH values were taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry code 1UJ1 at pH 6.0, 1UK3 at pH 7.6, and 1UK2 at pH 8.0). 13 In addition to simulations of the structural dynamics of the M pro at these pH values, calculations were also carried out at more acidic pH (pH 5.0). Since a crystal structure at a pH below 6.0 was not available at the time when these simulations were carried out, we used 1UJ1.pdb (pH 6.0) as the initial structural model, but with all histidine residues in the substrate-binding site (except His41) fully protonated. Prior to the simulations at pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and pH 7.6, residues SerA1 and GlyA2, which had not been visible in the electron density maps, 13 were modeled using the molecular modeling software Sybyl 6.8 (Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO, 2000). The modeled conformation at the beginning of each simulation was similar to that of residues SerB1 and GlyB2 of the other polypeptide chain in the dimer, which did exhibit welldefined electron density. The program package Macro-Dox version 3.2.2 29 was used to assign the titratable residues in the protein. The resulting charges of ionizable groups were appropriate for all four pH values studied, with all Arg and Lys residues protonated, and all Asp and Glu deprotonated. The protonation state of histidine residues was adopted from the MacroDox results, with the exception of His41 (see below) and of His163 and His172, which are associated with the S1 substratebinding subsite and are at the focus of the present study. Both the His163 residues of the A and the B chain of the M pro dimer were protonated in the simulation at pH 5.0, and unprotonated at pH 7.6 and 8.0. At pH 6.0, His163 was deprotonated in the A chain of the dimer, and protonated in the B chain. His172 of both chains was protonated at pH 5.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.6, but deprotonated in both chains at pH 8.0 (Table 2). Cys145 and His41 of the catalytic dyad were uncharged in all simulations, in agreement with the recent findings by Huang et al. 21 All simulations were performed using the GROMACS (version 3.1.4) package. 30,31 The GROMOS87 force field 32 was used with modifications as suggested by van Buuren et al. 33 and explicit hydrogen atoms in aromatic rings. 34 Electrostatic interactions between charged groups at a distance less than 9 Å were calculated explicitly, longrange electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method 35 with a grid width of 1.2 Å and a fourth-order spline interpolation. A cutoff distance of 9 Å was applied for Lennard-Jones interactions. To maintain the system at a constant temperature of 300 K, a Berendsen thermostat 36 was applied using a coupling time of 0.1 ps. The pressure was held at 1 bar, with a coupling time of 1.0 ps. The isothermal compressibility was 4.5!10 K5 bar K1 for water simulations. The time step was set as 2 fs. All bond lengths including hydrogen atoms were constrained by the LINCS algorithm. 37 The simulation cell was a rectangular periodic box with a minimum distance of 10 Å between the protein and the box walls, so that the protein would not interact directly with its own periodic image, given the cutoff. The protein was hydrated in a box containing simple point charge (SPC) water molecules. 38 A 100 mM NaCl solution was used, alongside a number of counterions to neutralize the total charge of the system. At the end, each system contained about 75,000 atoms.

All systems were minimized using the steepest descent method until the convergence value of 10 kJ mol K1 Å K1 was reached. When restraints were required on, e.g. protein atoms, a harmonic potential with a force constant of 0.1 kJ mol K1 Å K2 was applied. The simulation was initiated by dynamic equilibration of solvent molecules at 300 K for 100 ps, with velocity reassignment from a Maxwellian distribution of 0.2 ps intervals and the protein structure fixed. This was followed by fixing the protein main chain, and then the C a atoms, in restraint dynamics equilibration runs of 20 ps each. Afterwards, dynamic equilibration of the entire system (solute and solvent) was performed at 300 K for 20 ps. Following the equilibrations, four 10 ns MD simulation runs were performed, with all trajectories sampled every 1.0 ps.


Molecular dynamics simulations of the M pro monomer

Since protomer A of the M pro dimer as revealed by X-ray crystallography (pH 6.0; PDB code 1UJ1) was assumed to be in the active conformation, 13 it was selected as the reference structure in the MD simulation of the SARS-CoV M pro monomer. The MD simulations were carried out as described above for the M pro dimer. The simulation cell was a rectangular periodic box with a minimum distance of more than 7.5 Å between the protein and the box walls. To neutralize the system, 65 water molecules were replaced by 31 Cl and 34 Na ions. In total, the simulation system contained 2989 solute atoms and 11,665 solvent molecules embedded in a 59 Å !99 Å !68 Å box. Initially, all water molecules and ions, with the whole protein fixed, were energyminimized by steepest descent until the convergence value of 10 kJ mol K1 Å K1 was reached. Afterwards, minimizations were performed continuously on the protein by first fixing the main chain and subsequently the C a atoms. After the restraint dynamics equilibration, a 10 ns MD simulation was performed.


Calculation of binding site volume

The volume of the substrate-binding pocket was calculated using SURFNET. 39 This program first selects all atoms within 7 Å around a ligand (in this case, the peptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor used by Yang et al. 13 ) and then introduces spheres with a diameter ranging from 4 Å to 10 Å into the space between any two non-hydrogen atoms of the protein. The volume occupied by such spheres is then estimated.


Determination of enzymatic activity

The pentadecapeptide SWTSAVLQSGFRKWA was used as a substrate in an HPLC-based cleavage assay. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal autocleavage site of the SARS-CoV M pro , with the exception of the P7 Ile, which had been replaced by Trp, and the P6 0 Met, which had also been replaced by Trp. The concentrations of SARS-CoV M pro and substrate were 0.83 mM and 0.55 mM, respectively. The reactions were carried out at different pH values in 36 mM buffer solution. The buffer was sodium acetate for pH values between 4.5 and 5.6, bis-Tris for pH 5.8-7.0, bis-Tris-propane for pH 7.0-9.4. The enzymatic activity was found to be reduced by 20% in bis-Tris-propane buffer and this was corrected for. Reactions were run for 15 min and then stopped by addition of 0.1% trifluoric acid. After 5 min cooling on ice, samples were centrifuged and 90 ml of the supernatant were mixed with 60 ml of HPLC sample buffer. Separation of products and substrate was carried out using a reversephase (RP) HPLC column (Jupiter 4m Proteo 90A; Phenomenex) and a linear gradient (1%-90%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Detection of products and substrate was achieved using a fluorescence detector (RF1002, Gynkotec) at 353 nm.

For determination of the enzyme kinetics, substrate concentration was varied between 0.1 mM and 1.75 mM, at a constant enzyme concentration of 0.75 mM. Substrate and enzyme were incubated in 25 mM bis-Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 8C. Reaction aliquots were removed at different times up to 12 min, and analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above.
