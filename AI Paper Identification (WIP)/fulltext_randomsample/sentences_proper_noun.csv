1,"4 we compare HIJING [13], UrQMD [18], and AMPT model [19][20][21] calculations to the data for different centrality ranges.HIJING is a model that places special emphasis on perturbative QCD processes leading to multiple minijet production from parton scatterings.The model, which does not include final state rescattering except for schematic jet quenching, is found to do a good job in describing the data at mid-rapidity, but underestimates the widths of the multiplicity distributions at all centralities.The AMPT model uses HIJING to generate the initial phase space of partons, but then extends the calculations to model the parton-parton collisions and the final hadronic interactions.By including these final state interactions, the widths of the multiplicity distributions are found to agree well with experiment, suggesting the importance of these final state interactions.It is also interesting to note that the LUCIFER code [22] gives similar results to AMPT but within a purely hadronic formulation.The UrQMD transport model accounts for hadronic interactions at low and intermediate energies in terms of interactions between known hadrons and their resonances and at higher energies in terms of excitations of color strings and their subsequent fragmentation.For the present RHIC data, the shape of the pseudorapidity distributions are well reproduced, however with the particle production being way too large.The current results appear to rule out the UrQMD model as a description of the RHIC data.",16707705,True
